###**Mortality Analysis for the period 2003 to 2014**
####*HIV Mortality Analysis*

<br>
In order to explore HIV Mortality in Puerto Rico, we conducted a crude analysis using the data from the HIV Surveillance System for 2003 to 2014. The trend in HIV mortality can be seeing in figure 1:
<br>

<br>
Figure 1 shows the crude HIV mortality trend in Puerto Rico for the period 2003-2014. This preliminar analysis shows a decreasing HIV trend of 4.6% (10.0% in 2003 compared with 5.6% in 2014) in Puerto Rico. In figure 2 we stratified by mode of transmission (Men who have Sex with Men, Injection Drugs Users and Heterosexual Contact):

<br>  
Figure 2 also shows a decreasing trend in HIV in Puerto Rico. In the IDU group, we can see a decrease of almost 7% which might explain the reason why the overall mortality is also decreasing.

####*Comparing deaths of Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Injected Drugs Users (IDU)*

In order to compare deaths among MSM and IDU, we calculate the absolute difference between years (according to the CDC mathematical model) and verify whether there was a significant difference between these groups. The raw file can be accessed [here.](https://github.com/kramus/proptest/blob/master/propt3.csv)
<br>  
The structure of the data is as follows:
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(markdown)
library(pander)
library(knitr)
library(xtable)
```
<br>

The absolute differences of MSM and IDU cases for 2004-2014 are:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dat <- read.csv(".\\propt.csv")
dat <- dat[,c(1,6,7)]
names(dat)[2] <- "MSM"
names(dat)[3] <- "IDU"
pandoc.table(dat)
```
<br>  
To perform the analysis we used a Poisson model to compare the proportions between MSM and IDU. Figure 3 show the crude model. 
<br>

<br>  

In order to validate the model, we need to evaluate interaction in the predictor variables. Figure 4 show a significance in the likelihood-ratio test (p-value < 0.00001).
<br>  
![graphic 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kramus/proptest/master/LRtest.png)
<br>  

The likelihood-ratio test result indicates an interaction between the predictor variables. Thus the model with interaction was used in order to obtain the p-values. Table 1 show the respective p-values obtained in the Poisson model for the specific years: 


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, error=FALSE}

p_value <- c("< 0.0001", "0.205", "0.013", "0.017", "0.190","0.084","0.025","< 0.0001", "0.222", "< 0.0001", "0.010")
Year <- 2004:2014
tabla <- cbind(Year,p_value)
kable(xtable(tabla), format= "pandoc", align = "l")
```
<br>

We can see that for years 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2012 the results were not statistically significant (`r p_value[c(2,5,6,9)]` respectively). 

####JoinPoint Software
We used JoinPoint Software to verify if there were significant differences in the absolute differences calculated using the CDC mathematical model across the period of study. We ran the analysis for both MSM and IDU groups. Figure 5 show no significant difference in the annual percent change for the group MSM.
<br>

<br>  
Likewise, there was no statistical difference in the annual percent change for the IDU group.
<br>

<br>  


We found a statistical difference in the annual percent change for both groups (MSM and IDU) when we used the number of deaths as the dependent variable (figure 7 and 8, respectively):

Further investigation will be needed in order to have a better insight of the behavior of HIV mortality in Puerto Rico. <br>
