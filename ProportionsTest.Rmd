###**Proportions Test Analysis**
####*Comparing deaths of Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Injected Drugs Users (2003-2014)*
<br>
In order to conduct this analysis we used data from the HIV Surveillance System from the
years 2003 to 2014. 
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)

```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv(".\\propt3.csv")
data$case <- factor(data$case, levels(data$case)[c(2,1)]) 
#one way of changing order of levels
data$type <- relevel(data$type, "msm") #another way of changing order of levels
data1 <- xtabs(count ~type+case+year,data=data)
ftable(data1)
```
